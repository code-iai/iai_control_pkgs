You can use rename_topic.py to create a new bag-file from an old one with a new name for a topic. At the moment the new and old bag-file cannot have the same name.
To start the script use the following call:
python path-to-iai_rosbag_utils/src/rename_topic.py old.bag "old_topic" new.bag "new_topic"
